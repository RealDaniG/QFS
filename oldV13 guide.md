# 🟦 **QFS V12 LITE — FULL TREASURY, GOVERNANCE, WALLET & REWARD SYSTEM REPORT**

### **Version: TGR-12-Ω (Treasury-Governance-Rewards – Final Edition)**

---

# 1. **SYSTEM OVERVIEW**

The QFS V12 Lite financial layer is built around four pillars:

1. **Treasury System (QTRS)**
2. **Governance Framework (QGOV-Lite)**
3. **Wallet Architecture (Q-WAL V12 Lite)**
4. **Rewards & Economic Flow (Harmonic Rewards Engine – HRE12)**

Everything must be:

* Deterministic
* PQC-sealed
* Zero simulation
* Human-governance compatible
* Interoperable with AEIGS auditing
* Fully traceable
* Non-predictive

This ensures compliance with all V12 Lite certification standards.

---

# 2. **TREASURY SYSTEM — QTRS (QFS Treasury System)**

### 🟦 Purpose

The Treasury is the **central economic coordinator** for V12 Lite:

* Controls token distribution
* Handles reserves
* Manages reward allocations
* Acts as the financial truth layer

### 🟦 Core Components

### **2.1 Deterministic Treasury Ledger (DTL)**

* PQC-sealed ledger
* No predictive accounting
* Timestamped entries
* One-way deterministic hashing

### **2.2 Treasury Reserve Buckets (TRB)**

Each token has a reserve bucket:

* **CHR Reserve**: Coherence operations
* **FLX Reserve**: Flow stabilization
* **ΨSync Reserve**: Synchronization events
* **ATR Reserve**: Governance influence
* **RES Reserve**: Resonance-based reward modulation

Reserve refill rules:
✔ Triggered only by deterministic events
✔ No probabilistic triggers
✔ No adaptive flows

### **2.3 Treasury Outflow Protocol (TOP)**

Outflows (rewards, grants, governance allocations) must follow:

* PQC approval
* Treasury State Snapshot
* No simulation-based adjustments
* Deterministic formulas

### **2.4 Treasury Finality Seal**

At the end of each treasury cycle:

* Generate **TREASURY_FINALITY_SEAL.json**
* Auditor pulls via AEIGS endpoint
* Required for Phase 12.5 certification

---

# 3. **GOVERNANCE SYSTEM — QGOV-LITE**

QFS V12 Lite uses a **deterministic governance framework**.

### 🟦 Governance Roles

1. **Operator**

   * Executes system-level controls
   * Must complete CIR and D/R training

2. **Treasury Steward**

   * Manages QTRS outflows
   * PQC-signs all monetary actions

3. **Governance Committee**

   * Issues Go/No-Go approvals
   * Oversees audit reviews

4. **AEIGS External Auditor**

   * Pulls Finality Seals
   * Verifies PQC integrity

### 🟦 Governance Layers

### **3.1 QIAM Access Rules (Identity Matrix)**

All governance actions require:

* PQC signature
* Identity seal
* Role-level permission
* Deterministic decision path (no heuristics)

### **3.2 Governance Decision Engine (GDE)**

Governance votes must be:

* Binary (YES/NO)
* Deterministic
* PQC-signed
* Recorded in the **Governance Ledger (GOV-LED)**

### **3.3 Governance Cycles**

* **Microcycle:** Operational approvals
* **Mesocycle:** Treasury allocation decisions
* **Macrocycle:** Annual system updates & audit finality

### **3.4 Governance Failure Modes**

Clear D/R governance procedures:

1. Operator fails → Steward override
2. Steward fails → Committee override
3. Committee fails → PQC Emergency Seal

---

# 4. **WALLET SYSTEM — Q-WAL V12 LITE**

Designed for **identity-bound, deterministic, PQC-secure token management**.

### 🟦 Wallet Types

### **4.1 Operator Wallet**

* Used for governance signatures
* Holds ATR governance credits
* Includes a PQC-identity binding

### **4.2 User Wallet (Standard)**

* Holds the 5 V12 tokens
* Can receive rewards
* Cannot mint or influence governance without ATR

### **4.3 Treasury Wallet**

* Holds reserves
* Requires multi-role PQC signatures
* Cannot autonomously act (zero-sim constraint)

---

# 🟦 Wallet Internals

### **4.4 Deterministic Balance Engine**

Balances cannot update automatically.
Each update must be triggered by:

* Transaction event
* Treasury outflow rule
* Reward distribution cycle

### **4.5 PQC Wallet Seals**

Every transaction includes:

* Timestamp
* Role
* Event type
* Nonce
* PQC signature

### **4.6 QFS Token Interoperability Rules**

Tokens have strict transfer logic:

| Token | Transfer Type Allowed    | Restrictions          |
| ----- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| CHR   | Operational flows        | PQC only              |
| FLX   | Stabilization incentives | Must match flow event |
| ΨSync | Synchronization grants   | Must match sync event |
| ATR   | Governance credits       | Cannot be auto-issued |
| RES   | Reward multipliers       | Treasury-controlled   |

---

# 5. **REWARDS SYSTEM — HRE12 (Harmonic Rewards Engine)**

This system distributes:

* Resonance-based rewards
* Flow-based bonuses
* Governance incentives

All rewards must be:

* Deterministic
* Triggered by real events
* Zero-simulation compliant
* PQC approved if required

---

# 🟦 **5.1 Reward Types**

### **A. Coherence Rewards (CHR)**

Given when system maintains stable C_system levels.

Formula:

```
CHR_reward = (C_system_raw) * RES_multiplier
```

### **B. Flow Rewards (FLX)**

Triggered on continuous operational flow integrity.

### **C. Synchronization Rewards (ΨSync)**

Triggered when token flows reach harmony.
No prediction — must match actual event logs.

### **D. Governance Rewards (ATR)**

Issued to wallet holding ATR when:

* Governance actions completed
* Votes recorded
* PQC sign verified

### **E. Resonance Multipliers (RES)**

Treasury-controlled coefficient to boost reward level.
Must be recalculated **only from raw logs**.

---

# 🟦 **5.2 Reward Cycle Rules**

* Cycles run every **deterministic block window**
* Rewards require **snapshot → seal → process → seal**
* Auditor can verify through transaction logs
* No adaptive or AI-driven adjustments (Zero Simulation Mandate)

# 7. **AUDIT INTEGRATION — AEIGS**

All financial logic must produce:

### Required Files:

1. **TREASURY_FINALITY_SEAL.json**
2. **HRE_CYCLE_SEAL.json**
3. **GOVERNANCE_FINAL_SEAL.json**
4. **WALLET_STATE_SEAL.json**

The auditor must ingest these through:

* PQC/TLS endpoint
* Deterministic JSON schema
* Non-zero simulator-compliant fields

Phase 12.5 requires this verification.
