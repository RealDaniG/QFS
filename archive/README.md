This directory contains files, scripts, and documentation that are:

- **Deprecated**: No longer used in the active codebase.
- **Legacy**: Preserved for historical reference or previous version compatibility.
- **One-off**: Scripts ran once for specific fixes (e.g., `fix_bignum.py`).

**Note**: Code in this directory is NOT maintained, tested, or guaranteed to work with the current system. Do not import modules from here into production code.
