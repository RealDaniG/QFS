# Phase 3 Zero-Simulation Compliance Baseline
Date: 2025-12-17 20:03 CET
Git Commit: 1405f8d
Baseline Violations: 2,390

# Historical Context
- Phase 2 Baseline: 1,616 violations
- Delta: +774 violations (AEGIS/ATLAS integration, new features)
- Batch 1 Attempted: 1,616 → 2,029 (+413 - rolled back)
- Post-Rollback State: 2,390 (current baseline)

# Phase 3 Strategy: Pragmatic Incremental Reduction
Target: 2,390 → 0 violations through systematic batch fixes
Starting with Batch 2 (sorted iterations) - lower risk, proven approach

# Batch Plan
- Batch 2: Sorted iterations (~155 violations, 6.5% reduction)
- Batch 3: Global state refactoring (~160 violations, 7% reduction)
- Batch 4: Economics arithmetic migration (~613 violations, 26% reduction)
- Batch 5: Manual review queue (~1,462 violations, 61% reduction)

# Success Metrics
- Week 1 Target: 2,390 → 1,800 (25% reduction)
- Week 2 Target: 1,800 → 1,200 (50% total reduction)
- Week 3 Target: 1,200 → 600 (75% total reduction)
- Week 4 Target: 600 → 0 (100% compliance)
