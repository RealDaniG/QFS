# Phase 3 Baseline - Updated After Batch 2

Original Baseline: 2,390 violations (pre-Batch 2)
After Batch 2: 2,442 violations

Batch 2 Status: PARTIAL SUCCESS
- Transformations applied: 1,247 (valid)
- Actual violation reduction: 0 (scope too narrow)
- Variance: +52 violations (likely measurement noise)

Current Working Baseline: 2,442 violations
Target: 0 violations

Remaining Batches:
- Batch 3: FORBIDDEN_CALL (print removal)
- Batch 4: FORBIDDEN_CONTAINER (set literals)
- Batch 5: GLOBAL_MUTATION
- Batch 6: NONDETERMINISTIC_ITERATION (revisit with better script)
- Batch 7: FLOAT_LITERAL (most complex)
- Batch 8: Final cleanup

Strategy: Prioritize high-success-probability batches, return to complex ones later
