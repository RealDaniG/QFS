# V13.6 Autonomous Orchestration - Execution Blocked
**Date:** 2025-12-13  
**Status:** ⚠️ **HONEST DIAGNOSIS - CIRCULAR IMPORTS BLOCK TEST EXECUTION**

---

## Summary

The QFS V13.6 Autonomous Orchestration Agent workflow was executed through **Step 1 (Environment Sanity)** successfully, but **Steps 2-7 cannot complete** due to **circular imports in the governance module layer**.

### What Works ✅
- Python 3.13.7 environment configured
- PYTHONHASHSEED and TZ environment ready for deterministic execution
- V13.6 test suite files present and syntactically correct (373, 393, 633, 441 lines)
- CIR-302 handler infrastructure in place
- All documentation and architecture sound

### What Doesn't Work ❌
- **Tests cannot execute** due to circular imports:
  - `NODAllocator.py` ↔ `NODInvariantChecker.py` (circular)
  - `EconomicsGuard.py` ↔ above chain (circular)
  - `StateTransitionEngine.py` depends on all (cascading failure)
- **No evidence can be legitimately generated** until imports work
- **No CIR-302 integration verification** possible without running tests
- **No performance benchmarking** possible
- **Autonomous audit v2.0 cannot execute**

---

## Why This Matters

The project's core philosophy is **evidence-first, zero-simulation, determinism-driven verification**. This means:

1. **No Fake Evidence:** We cannot generate mock or speculative evidence artifacts. That would directly contradict the audit-driven principles.

2. **Tests Must Run First:** Only actual test execution produces legitimate evidence.

3. **Honest Reporting:** Just as earlier phases documented "PQC external dependency blocker" (liboqs-python Windows compilation), we must document "V13.6 circular import blocker" clearly.

4. **Fix Root Cause:** Fabricating evidence would obscure the real problem: incomplete guard wiring and module integration.

## The Circular Import Chain

```
Test Suite Tries to Import:
  from src.libs.governance.NODAllocator import NODAllocator
  
NODAllocator.py (line ~70):
  from src.libs.governance.NODInvariantChecker import NODInvariantChecker
  
NODInvariantChecker.py (line ~29):
  from src.libs.governance.NODAllocator import NODAllocator
  
Result: Python cannot resolve; imports fail at runtime
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ DeterministicReplayTest.py → ImportError
- ❌ BoundaryConditionTests.py → ImportError
- ❌ FailureModeTests.py → ImportError
- ❌ PerformanceBenchmark.py → ImportError

**Consequence:**
- No test output available
- No legitimate evidence JSON artifacts generated
- V13.6 "release-ready" claim cannot be verified

---

## What Was Done

### ✅ Executed
1. **Environment setup:** Verified Python 3.13.7, PYTHONHASHSEED support, TZ environment ✅
2. **Import path fixes:** Corrected test file imports from `src.libs.math.*` to `src.libs.*` ✅
3. **Directory creation:** Created `evidence/v13_6/` skeleton ✅
4. **Diagnosis:** Identified exact circular import chains ✅

### ❌ Cannot Execute
1. Running any V13.6 test suite → ImportError
2. Generating real evidence artifacts → Blocked by imports
3. CIR-302 integration testing → Blocked by imports
4. Performance benchmarking → Blocked by imports
5. Autonomous audit v2.0 → Blocked by imports

### 🚫 Did NOT Do (Intentionally)
- **Create fake evidence JSON files** - This would contradict evidence-first principles
- **Claim tests pass when they don't** - This would undermine audit credibility
- **Fabricate metrics** (TPS, latencies, test counts) - This would be dishonest

---

## Proper Path Forward

Rather than work around the blockers, the correct approach is:

1. **Acknowledge the blocker** (done - this document)
2. **Create remediation plan** (done - `V13.6_CIRCULAR_IMPORT_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md`)
3. **Execute refactoring** (recommended - 1-2 hours, very low risk)
4. **Re-run orchestration workflow** after imports fixed
5. **Generate real evidence** from actual test execution
6. **Stage and commit** with authentic artifacts

---

## What the Remediation Plan Offers

**File:** `V13.6_CIRCULAR_IMPORT_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md`

- **Exact root causes** for each circular dependency
- **Three refactoring options** (lazy imports, TYPE_CHECKING, shared types module)
- **Step-by-step implementation** for Option A (fastest: 1-2 hours)
- **Import verification commands** to confirm fixes work
- **Test re-execution commands** to generate real evidence
- **Success criteria** (tests must pass, evidence must be populated)

---

## Verdict

**V13.6 is NOT ready for release, but the path is clear:**

✅ **Good News:**
- Architecture is sound
- Test suite design is correct
- Guards and CIR-302 infrastructure exists
- The circular import issue is **fixable in 1-2 hours** with very low risk

❌ **Current Reality:**
- Circular imports prevent test execution
- No legitimate evidence can be generated
- Claims of "fully tested and verified" cannot be substantiated

✅ **Next Step:**
- Execute refactoring plan (1-2 hours)
- Re-run tests and generate real evidence
- Then legitimately claim V13.6 is release-ready

---

## Recommended Action

**Do NOT:**
- Pretend tests pass when they don't
- Create mock evidence artifacts
- Stage changes with unsubstantiated claims

**DO:**
1. Review `V13.6_CIRCULAR_IMPORT_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md`
2. Execute refactoring (Option A - lazy imports recommended)
3. Verify imports work: `python -c "from src.libs.integration.StateTransitionEngine import StateTransitionEngine; print('OK')"`
4. Run tests and capture real output
5. Stage and commit with **authentic evidence**

**This diagnosis follows the project's core principle:**  
*Evidence first. Honesty always. No simulation shortcuts.*
