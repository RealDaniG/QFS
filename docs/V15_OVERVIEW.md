# v15 Overview: The Timeless Protocol & Autonomous Governance

## Introduction

v15 represents the "Autonomous Era" of QFS. While v14 locked down the deterministic core (Zero-Sim, Sessions), v15 empowers the protocol to govern itself.

## The HSMF Progress (v15 Roadmap)

The Hybrid Social-Metric Framework (HSMF) has evolved through 5 stages:

### Stage 1: Social Signals (Complete)

- Standardized events (Likes, Shares).
- Deterministic ingestion via `SocialBridge`.

### Stage 2: Invariant Governance (Complete)

- `NODInvariantChecker` enforcing vote legitimacy.
- Constitution-first design.

### Stage 3: Viral Determinism (Complete)

- `ViralEngine`: Replayable scoring logic.
- Proof-of-Reach artifacts.

### Stage 4: Economic Feedback Loops (Complete)

- `ViralRewardBinder`: Algorithmic Reward Distribution.
- Capped Emissions logic.

### Stage 5: Autonomous Governance (Live)

- **Self-Amendment**: Hash-bound proposals update Registry parameters.
- **Proof-of-Execution**: Verifiable governance trails.
- **Status**: Live in `v15/atlas/governance`.

### Stage 6: Execution Wiring (Live)

- **Triggers**: Epoch-bound activation.
- **Coherence**: AEGIS cryptographic verification.
- **Status**: Live in `v15/atlas/aegis`.

### Stage 7: Production Release (Live)

- **Release**: v15.0.0 Tagged.
- **Status**: ATLAS v1.3 Ready.

## The Path Forward (ATLAS v1.3)

Integration of the v15 Governance Core into the mainnet release is targeted for Q1 2026. This will allow:

1. Community-driven parameter tuning.
2. Transparent, on-chain protocol upgrades.
3. Full automated auditability via AEGIS.
