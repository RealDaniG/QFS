**Release Date:** 2025-12-20
**Branch:** `feat/v17-governance-bounty-f-layer` -> `main`
**Tag:** `v17.0.0-beta-governance-bounties`

## Summary

This release establishes the **v17 F-Layer**, the deterministic engine for Quantum Financial System (QFS) governance, bounty distribution, and social coordination. It is the first release to fully integrate the **EvidenceBus** with **Zero-Simulation** compliance, ensuring every state change is an auditable, cryptographic event.

## Key Features

### 1. Governance F-Layer

- **Deterministic Proposals & Voting:** Hash-based IDs, pure state reconstruction.
- **Outcome Computation:** Configurable quorum/approval logic, strictly enforced.
- **PoE Logging:** All governance actions emit verifiable events.

### 2. Bounty F-Layer

- **Reward Engine:** Deterministic allocation with `max_reward_per_contributor_ratio` caps.
- **Proof-of-Contribution:** Contributions linked to generic proofs (URLs, hashes).
- **Advisory Integration:** Non-authoritative AI signal slots.

### 3. Social Surface (Layer C)

- **Thread Binding:** Discussions strictly linked to Proposal/Bounty IDs.
- **User History:** Comprehensive, aggregated timeline of all user actions.
- **Disputes:** Formal dispute mechanism for accountability.

### 4. Visibility (Layer B)

- **Admin Dashboard:** Real-time projection of governance usage and user profiles.
- **Hardened Security:** Double-vote prevention, strict validation, and privacy controls.

## Next Steps

- **v17.1:** UX Polish & Observability.
- **Layer D:** Agent Advisory & Automation.
