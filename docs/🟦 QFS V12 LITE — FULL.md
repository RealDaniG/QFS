🟦 QFS V12 LITE — FULL TREASURY, GOVERNANCE, WALLET & REWARD SYSTEM REPORT
Version: TGR-12-Ω (Treasury-Governance-Rewards – Final Edition)
1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW

The QFS V12 Lite financial layer is structured around four deterministic pillars:

Treasury System (QTRS)

Governance Framework (QGOV-Lite)

Wallet Architecture (Q-WAL V12 Lite)

Rewards & Economic Flow (Harmonic Rewards Engine – HRE12)

All operations must satisfy:

Deterministic execution

PQC-sealed transaction integrity

Zero-simulation compliance

Human-governance alignment

AEIGS audit compatibility

Full traceability

Non-predictive operation

2. TREASURY SYSTEM — QTRS
🟦 Purpose

Acts as the central economic coordinator:

Manages token distribution

Maintains reserve integrity

Executes reward allocations

Ensures financial finality

🟦 Core Components

2.1 Deterministic Treasury Ledger (DTL)

PQC-sealed, one-way hash ledger

Non-predictive, timestamped entries

Immutable deterministic calculation paths

2.2 Treasury Reserve Buckets (TRB)

Token	Reserve Purpose	Flow Rules
CHR	Coherence operations	Deterministic events only
FLX	Flow stabilization	No adaptive triggers
ΨSync	Synchronization events	Event-triggered only
ATR	Governance influence	PQC-signed only
RES	Reward multipliers	Treasury-controlled, log-only updates

2.3 Treasury Outflow Protocol (TOP)

Requires PQC approval

Deterministic snapshot-based calculations

No simulation, no adaptive adjustments

2.4 Treasury Finality Seal

TREASURY_FINALITY_SEAL.json generated per cycle

Auditor pulls via AEIGS endpoint

Mandatory for Phase 12.5 certification

3. GOVERNANCE SYSTEM — QGOV-LITE
🟦 Governance Roles

Operator: executes system controls; CIR & D/R certified

Treasury Steward: manages QTRS outflows; PQC-signs all monetary actions

Governance Committee: approves Go/No-Go; oversees audits

AEIGS External Auditor: verifies finality seals; confirms PQC integrity

🟦 Governance Layers

3.1 QIAM Access Rules (Identity Matrix)

PQC signature + role identity required

Deterministic decision paths only

No heuristic or probabilistic governance

3.2 Governance Decision Engine (GDE)

Binary YES/NO voting

PQC-signed, logged in Governance Ledger (GOV-LED)

3.3 Governance Cycles

Cycle Type	Purpose
Microcycle	Operational approvals
Mesocycle	Treasury allocation decisions
Macrocycle	Annual system updates & audit finality

3.4 Governance Failure Modes

Operator fails → Steward override

Steward fails → Committee override

Committee fails → PQC Emergency Seal

4. WALLET SYSTEM — Q-WAL V12 LITE

Identity-bound, deterministic, PQC-secure wallet design.

🟦 Wallet Types

4.1 Operator Wallet: governance actions, ATR holdings, PQC-identity bound
4.2 User Wallet: holds CHR, FLX, ΨSync, ATR, RES; receives rewards; cannot mint
4.3 Treasury Wallet: holds reserves; requires multi-role PQC signatures; zero-sim autonomous activity forbidden

🟦 Wallet Internals

4.4 Deterministic Balance Engine

Balance updates only via deterministic triggers:

Transaction events

Treasury outflow

Reward cycles

4.5 PQC Wallet Seals

Timestamp

Role

Event type

Nonce

PQC signature

4.6 Token Interoperability Rules

Token	Allowed Transfer Type	Restrictions
CHR	Operational flows	PQC only
FLX	Stabilization incentives	Must match flow event
ΨSync	Synchronization grants	Event-triggered only
ATR	Governance credits	Cannot auto-issue
RES	Reward multipliers	Treasury-controlled only
5. REWARDS SYSTEM — HRE12

Distributes deterministic rewards:

Coherence-based (CHR)

Flow integrity (FLX)

Synchronization grants (ΨSync)

Governance incentives (ATR)

Resonance multipliers (RES)

5.1 Reward Formulas

CHR Reward:

CHR_reward = C_system_raw * RES_multiplier


FLX Reward: triggered on operational flow integrity
ΨSync Reward: triggered on synchronization events
ATR Reward: awarded to ATR holders on PQC-verified governance actions
RES Multiplier: treasury-controlled coefficient based on raw logs only

5.2 Reward Cycle Rules

Deterministic block window cycles

Require snapshot → seal → process → seal

Auditor verification via transaction logs

No AI-driven or adaptive adjustments

7. AUDIT INTEGRATION — AEIGS
Required Files:

WALLET_STATE_SEAL.json

Pulled via PQC/TLS endpoint

Deterministic JSON schema

Fully zero-simulation compliant
