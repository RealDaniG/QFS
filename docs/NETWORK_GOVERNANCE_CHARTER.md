# QFS × ATLAS — Network Governance Charter

> **Version:** v18.0.0-alpha  
> **Status:** Draft (Operational Decentralization Focus)

This charter defines the roles, responsibilities, and governance mechanisms for the QFS × ATLAS distributed fabric.

## 1. Participant Roles

- **Operator (Tier A):** Runs high-availability consensus nodes, secures logs with PQC anchors.
- **Steward (Layer B):** Directs the advisory and social surface, participates in governance disputes.
- **Auditor (Layer C/D):** Observes the fabric, verifies anchors, and reports anomalies.
- **User:** Primary beneficiary and participant in the social and economic layers.

## 2. Node Onboarding & Diversity

- **Admission:** new Tier A operators must be approved via v17 Governance Proposal.
- **Diversity Cap:** No single entity or affiliate group may control >20% of the active validator slots.
- **Slashing:** Malicious behavior (double-signing, extended downtime) triggers automated proposals for removal.

## 3. Consensus Governance

- **Parameter Tuning:** Quorum sizes, block/batch intervals, and PQC rotation policies are governed by v17 proposals.
- **Upgrades:** Protocol versions must be ratified by a majority of the governance stake before being enforced at the network level.

---

**Mission:** To ensure that no single operator, organization, or developer controls the connectivity or history of the QFS × ATLAS ecosystem.
