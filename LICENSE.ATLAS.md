Project Name: QFS × ATLAS
Public License: GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0) or later

Current Status: Sole developer project (no external contributions as of December 2025). IP registration for "ATLAS" and related marks in process; Swiss entity formation underway.

1. Public License
The source code in this repository is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPL-3.0) or any later version, as published by the Free Software Foundation.
AGPL-3.0 is a strong copyleft open-source license that permits:

Use, study, modification, and execution of the software for any purpose, including commercial and SaaS deployments.
Distribution of the software and modifications.
Provision of the software as a network service.

Provided that recipients and network users receive:

Access to the complete corresponding source code (including any modifications).
Preservation of all copyright, license, and attribution notices.
Licensing of any modifications or derivative works under AGPL-3.0 (or later).

See the full LICENSE file (AGPL-3.0 text) for authoritative terms.
2. Project Stewardship and Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
QFS × ATLAS is stewarded by a forthcoming Swiss legal entity (the "Project Steward"), currently under formation. The project remains under sole ownership and control of the original developer until entity completion.
As the project is currently developed by a single contributor with no external contributions:

No CLA is required at present.
Future contributions will require acceptance of a Contributor License Agreement (to be published as CLA.md).

The CLA will ensure:

Contributors retain ownership of their contributions.
Contributors grant the Project Steward a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, modify, distribute, sublicense (including under proprietary terms), and create derivative works from contributions.
Public contributions remain licensed under AGPL-3.0 in this repository.
The Project Steward may dual-license or offer commercial alternatives without restricting public AGPL-3.0 availability.

This structure supports long-term sustainability, security, and determinism while preserving openness.
3. Dual-Licensing and Commercial/Enterprise Use
The Project Steward (once formed) reserves the right to offer alternative licenses, including commercial/enterprise licenses (e.g., for proprietary integrations, audited builds, support, or embedded use without AGPL-3.0 obligations).

The public repository and core codebase will always remain available under AGPL-3.0.
Users may rely solely on AGPL-3.0 without any commercial agreement, subject to full compliance.
Commercial licenses will be available for scenarios where AGPL-3.0 obligations are incompatible with business needs.

This follows established open-core practices (e.g., iText, MinIO) enabled by sole ownership and future CLA.
4. Trademarks and Branding
"QFS", "ATLAS", "QFS × ATLAS", associated logos, and related branding are trademarks (registered or pending) of the Project Steward.

AGPL-3.0 grants no trademark rights.
Nominative/fair use is permitted for accurate references (e.g., "compatible with QFS × ATLAS" or "fork of QFS × ATLAS") without implying endorsement.
Prohibited uses include:
Suggesting official affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement.
Using marks in domain names, product names, or logos that could cause confusion.
Modified or derivative branding implying official status.

Trademark registration is in process via the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property (IPI). Guidelines will be published separately.
5. No Warranty and No Legal Advice
The software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind (see AGPL-3.0 Section 15-16).
This notice is a summary for clarity and is not legal advice. Authoritative terms are in:

LICENSE (AGPL-3.0 full text)
Future CLA.md
Trademark guidelines (forthcoming)

Consult independent legal counsel for specific situations, especially regarding Swiss IP law, company formation, or compliance.
Intent and Purpose
This structure protects the project from unauthorized commercial exploitation (e.g., rebranding and resale without contribution) while encouraging open collaboration. It enables sustainable development via future enterprise offerings, hosted services, or support—common in AGPL projects.
As a single-developer project transitioning to Swiss stewardship, this maximizes protection pre-registration: copyright is automatic, trademarks are defended through use/enforcement, and AGPL-3.0 prevents closed-source forks in SaaS contexts.
Updates will follow entity formation and IP registration completion.
