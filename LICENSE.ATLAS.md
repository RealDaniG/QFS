## 1. Public License

The QFS × ATLAS source code in this repository is made available under the **GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3** (“AGPL‑3.0”), or any later version as published by the Free Software Foundation.

AGPL‑3.0 is a strong copyleft license. It allows you to:

* Run, study, and use the software for any purpose, including commercial deployment.
* Modify the software and distribute your modifications.
* Offer the software as a service over a network.

…provided that you:

* Provide recipients and network users access to the **complete corresponding source code** of the version you run or distribute, including your modifications.

## 2. Stewardship and Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

QFS × ATLAS is an **open, deterministic financial and governance system**, stewarded by a single accountable entity (the “Project Steward”). To protect the system, maintain determinism, and allow sustainable commercial offerings, contributions are governed by a **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)** in addition to AGPL‑3.0.

By contributing code, documentation, or other material:

* You retain ownership of your contributions.
* You grant the Project Steward a **perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license**, including the right to sublicense, to use, modify, and distribute your contributions and derivative works under any license, including commercial or proprietary terms.
* Your contributions remain publicly available under **AGPL‑3.0** as part of the repository.

Key points about the CLA:

* It **does not** remove your rights to use your own code elsewhere.
* It **does not** reduce the transparency of the public repository.
* It **does not** give you the right to relicense contributions made by others.

See `CLA.md` for the full Contributor License Agreement.

## 3. Dual‑Licensing and Commercial Use

Thanks to the CLA, the Project Steward may license QFS × ATLAS under **alternative or commercial terms** alongside the AGPL‑3.0 public version.

This dual-licensing model ensures:

* The public codebase remains open, auditable, and AGPL‑licensed.
* Commercial or enterprise versions can exist to support sustainable development, audits, and security work.

Using the software solely under **AGPL‑3.0** does **not** require any commercial agreement.

## 4. Trademarks and Branding

Names and logos such as **“QFS”**, **“ATLAS”**, and related branding are trademarks of the Project Steward.

* AGPL‑3.0 **does not** grant any rights to use these trademarks.
* Any use implying endorsement or official affiliation requires explicit permission.

For commercial use of trademarks, contact the Project Steward and follow published trademark guidelines.

* AGPL‑3.0 license (`LICENSE`)
* Contributor License Agreement (`CLA.md`)

For specific legal questions, please seek counsel.

---

**Intent & Purpose:**

If you want, I can also **draft a matching `CLA.md`** that is fully aligned with this license, ready for contributors to sign. This would make your repo fully contributor-ready and legally robust. Do you want me to do that next?
