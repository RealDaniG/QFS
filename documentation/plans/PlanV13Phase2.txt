QFS V13 – Phase 2: SDK Integration & Coherence Enforcement
Objective

Convert CertifiedMath operations into fully coherent transaction bundles using the SDK. Phase 2 enforces PQC integrity, automatic audit trails, and deterministic operation encapsulation, ensuring every state mutation in QFS V13 is cryptographically verifiable and deterministic.

I. SDK Client Development

Goal: Wrap all CertifiedMath operations in a coherent, auditable SDK layer.

Task	Details
CertifiedMath Wrappers	Implement SDK methods mirroring all CertifiedMath functions (add, sub, mul, div, sqrt, phi_series). Each wrapper:
• Validates DRV_Packet input
• Performs the deterministic math operation
• Records operation in audit log
• Generates PQC signature for integrity
PQC Signature Generation	Every operation produces a Post-Quantum Commit (PQC) signature, binding input, operation, and output.
Audit Trail Automation	SDK serializes operation details (operands, result, DRV_Packet hash, PQC signature) to a centralized log for CRS hash chain validation.
Context Management	Provide automatic initialization and teardown for SDK sessions. Include secure key management for PQC operations.
II. Deterministic Transaction Bundles

Goal: Treat each math operation as an atomic, auditable transaction.

Task	Details
Atomic Operation Packaging	Bundle: DRV_Packet + CertifiedMath operation + result + PQC signature.
Serialized Logging	Each bundle is logged in deterministic order. Use lexicographic ordering to ensure consistent audit hash.
Operation ID / Sequencing	Assign a unique operation ID for every transaction based on deterministic hashing of input and previous log entry.
Pre-Validation	SDK verifies previous hash and PQC signature before applying next operation. Ensures chain integrity.
III. API-SDK Integration

Goal: Connect Phase 1 API with Phase 2 SDK for full coherence.

Task	Details
Direct API Call Replacement	Instead of calling raw CertifiedMath functions via API, route all requests through SDK client.
PQC Verification Middleware	API validates PQC signatures generated by SDK. Rejects any non-compliant operation.
Audit Synchronization	API forwards SDK logs to central audit repository. Maintains CRS hash chain for all transactions.
IV. Deterministic Governance and Input Validation

Goal: Ensure SDK operations enforce all deterministic rules.

Task	Details
DRV_Packet Enforcement	SDK validates timestamp, sequence number, and deterministic seed.
Critical Coherence Threshold	SDK checks system parameters (C_CRIT, token thresholds) before allowing operation.
Pre-Commit SDK Hooks	Integrate SDK hooks for local zero-simulation enforcement and DRV_Packet validation.
V. Quantum-Ready Preparation

Goal: Make SDK fully compatible with Phase 3 quantum enhancements.

Task	Details
Quantum Randomness Integration Points	SDK supports optional quantum seed for deterministic operations.
Quantum-Secured Audit Fields	Reserve audit log fields for quantum signature and random seed attestation.
Future Optimization Hooks	SDK functions structured to support quantum algorithms (Grover, Shor) for optimized calculations without breaking determinism.
VI. Verification & QA
Task	Details
Unit Testing	Test SDK wrapper functions for correctness, audit log integrity, and PQC signature validation.
Integration Testing	API ↔ SDK ↔ CertifiedMath full transaction lifecycle.
Audit Verification	Ensure CRS hash chain reproduces consistently across nodes.
Performance Testing	Benchmark SDK overhead and PQC throughput. Target ≥ 2,000 TPS.
Deterministic Replay	Replay transaction bundles in test environment to verify bit-for-bit determinism.
VII. Deliverables (Phase 2)

Fully implemented QFS V13 SDK with CertifiedMath wrappers.

Automatic audit trail generation for all SDK transactions.

PQC signature generation & verification for all operations.

Integrated API ↔ SDK flow enforcing deterministic, auditable operations.

Test suite covering unit, integration, audit verification, and deterministic replay.

Quantum-ready SDK hooks for future Phase 3 enhancements.

Outcome

Upon completion of Phase 2:

Every CertifiedMath operation becomes a deterministic, PQC-signed, auditable transaction.

API exposure from Phase 1 is fully coherent, enforcing the CRS hash chain.

SDK serves as the primary enforcement layer for QFS V13 coherence, ensuring that no state mutation can occur outside the deterministic, PQC-protected framework.

The system is fully prepared for Phase 3 Quantum Integration, including quantum-secured entropy and advanced mathematical operations.
