# Session Complete: v16 Baseline Narrative

**Date:** December 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Released to Main  
**Baseline:** v16 (Deterministic, Cost-Efficient)

---

## 🏁 Objective Achieved

We have successfully transitioned the QFS × ATLAS narrative and roadmap to the **v16 Baseline**. This milestone defines the platform as "Ready for Real-World Use," emphasizing MOCKQPC-first architecture, AGPL-3.0 licensing, and disciplined singleton scaling.

## 📦 Deliverables

### 1. Narrative & Positioning (README.md)

* ✅ **Updated Introduction:** Replaces technical overview with a clear "Problem/Solution" narrative.
* ✅ **Product Evolution:** Explicitly defines v14 (Foundation) → v15 (Clarity) → v16 (Real-World).
* ✅ **Key Benefits:** Focuses on Trust, Fairness, and Cost Control for users/investors.
* ✅ **Security:** Retains the "Deterministic Crypto & Zero-Sim" technical assurances.

### 2. Roadmap Alignment (PLATFORM_EVOLUTION_PLAN.md)

* ✅ **Foundation Updated:** Now explicitly cites "Evergreen v16 Baseline" as the starting point.
* ✅ **MOCKQPC Integration:** Confirmed as complete and foundational to the v16 strategy.

### 3. PR Artifacts

* ✅ **PR Template:** `docs/PR_TEMPLATE_v16.md` created with the exact narrative requested.
* ✅ **Commit:** `feat: v16 baseline narrative – deterministic, cost-efficient QFS × ATLAS` pushed to main.

## 🧪 Verification

**Script:** `python scripts/verify_mockqpc_determinism.py` (Local Check)
**Result:** **PASS** (100% Deterministic)

The system remains structurally verified while the positioning has evolved to be user/investor-ready.

## 🚀 Next Steps (User)

1. **Announce:** Use the PR description and README narrative for your v16 announcement (Patreon/Discord).
2. **Operate:** Deploy the v16 baseline to a beta node (`ENV=beta`) using the `DEV_GUIDE.md` flows.
3. **Grow:** Execute "Phase 2" (Wallet ↔ GitHub) on top of this stable v16 foundation.
